Hello I'm Isha and welcome to my blog!

I'm currently an undergrad student (2nd year) studying Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
I really believe in this world electricity is the closest thing to magic, and although I'm lost most of the times, I want to pursue a career in this field.

I was a bit _taken_ with cybersecurity so you can find some of my writeups here but currently I want to focus on core EE topics and actual projects I can showcase. The programming language I'm most comfortable in has gotta be *C* and I'm not really interested in learning other languages right now.

Recently I've started learning about *FPGAs*. I've worked with microcontrollers before (ESP32 and Arduino) but FPGAs are beasts and are used in the actual industry. Since I'm kinda broke I can't afford most FPGAs so I'm just doing them in simulation now (not for too long hopefully)

Anyways, feel free to reach out for collaborations or just to geek out about electronics!
